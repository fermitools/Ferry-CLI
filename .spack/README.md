## Disclaimer: Deprecation Notice

Per ticket [#95](https://github.com/fermitools/Ferry-CLI/issues/95), the .spack directory and associated Spack package will remain in this repository for the time being. However, it will not be updated to support future changes, as we are moving away from Spack support.

Users relying on this package should be aware that it may become incompatible with future updates and are encouraged to transition to alternative solutions.

For any questions or concerns, refer to ticket [#95](https://github.com/fermitools/Ferry-CLI/issues/95) or contact the maintainers.
